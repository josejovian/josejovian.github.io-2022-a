## Project Overview

This project is my attempt to solve the [challenge to create a full-stack application from DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wP0LbGgEeKhpFHUpPpDh). I also have made sure to complete all the user stories. Despite the fact that I used only React and Firebase, I think my attempt is still somehow decent.

Disclone is essentially a chatting application, where users can send and read messages in a text channel, or even create a new text channel. To access these features, the users must first be logged in.

## Tech Stacks and Libraries

This project uses React, and Firebase. One important library that I used in this project is React Infinite Scroll, such that all chat messages are not rendered at once. I also used Chakra UI for the styling. 

## Highlighted Features

### Real-Time Channel and Chat Update

In order to implement this, I simply used this [specific feature of Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write#web_value_events). When changes occur within the messages of a channel, a redux state update (the messages) will occur, so the users who are currently viewing the channel will see this update (the new messages) in real time. Likewise, the users will also see the new channels as soon as they are created.
