## Project Overview

This project is my attempt to solve the [challenge to create a full-stack application from DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wP0LbGgEeKhpFHUpPpDh). I also have made sure to complete all the user stories. Despite the fact that I used only React and Firebase, I think my attempt is still somehow decent.

Disclone is essentially a chatting application, where users can send and read messages in a text channel, or even create a new text channel. To access these features, the users must first be logged in.

## Tech Stacks and Libraries

This project uses React, and Firebase. I also used Chakra UI for the styling.

## Highlighted Features

### Real-Time Chat

In order to implement this, I simply used this [specific feature of Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write#web_value_events). When changes occur, the state to save messages are simply updated.
In other words, when a new message is being sent on a specific channel, only the users who are in the current channel will see the redux state update.
