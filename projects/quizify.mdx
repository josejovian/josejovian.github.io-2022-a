## Project Overview

This application is the final project of the Agile Software Development course that I took. I worked in this project with four other people, and this project is done in a few sprints. Our group were still very new to React when developing this application, so it definitely can be improved.

Quizify is an application, where people can create and do quizzes. To access the app's features, the user must be logged in.
