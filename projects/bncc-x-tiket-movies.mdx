## Project Overview

This is a final project of the **Frontend Development Bootcamp** at BNCC Academy 2021/2022, which I participated in. I worked on this project with four other people, and each of us worked on a specific part of the application.

BNCC x Tiket Movies is an app where people can view new movies, search for movies, and add them to their favorite list. 

## Tech Stacks and Libraries

We mainly used NextJS. The following are other libraries or API that we use:
- **TheMovieDB API**, to get movie data and TMDB account authentication.
- **Axios**, to handle API calls.
- **Redux**, for state management.
- **Redux Persist**, to ensure that the states persist within pages, even if the user closes the tab, by saving the states in the user's local storage.

## Highlighted Features

### Account Login

After a user inputs their TMDB username and password, clicking the login button will trigger three API calls, as parts of the authentication process with TMDB:
- Get new token.
- Validate the new token using the username and password, to create a new session.
- Request for user data using the session ID.

### View Profile

Users can see the movies in their favorites. Visiting the page triggers an API call that will request for the user's favorites from TMDB.

### Movie Search

Users can search for movies using the search bar in the landing page. Clicking the search button will trigger an API call that will return movies, given the search query.

### Add a Movie to Favorites

When viewing a movie, logged in users can add it to their favorites by clicking a button. Clicking the button will trigger an API call to TMDB that will actually add the current movie to the user's favorites.
